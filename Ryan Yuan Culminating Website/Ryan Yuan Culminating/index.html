            <h2>Music</h2>
            <p>
              I love music. Music plays a hugely important role in our emotional, intellectual, and even physical lives. It impacts the ways we work, relax, behave, and feel. It can make us smile or cry, it helps us bond with the people around us, and it even has the power to alleviate a range of medical conditions. My favorite genre of music is Hip Hop. My favorite two artists are J Cole and Drake. I like them because they have meaningful lyrics in their songs; most of their songs have a lot of beats which I find enjoyable.

            <h2>Interests/Hobbies</h2>
            <p>
              I have a few hobbies that include: soccer and coding. I play many sports but I play soccer the most and something I play competitively. This year, at Milliken, I played for the varsity boys soccer team and was the first-ever in Milliken History to go undefeated in a season then advanced into finals. I play at the highest level of soccer at my age; the OPDL. The team that I play for is Markham FC and this season, we came first in the East division and beat the first-place team on the west division to take the championship title; "Best team in Ontario." I also used to swim competitively for a team called MAC but quit when I was around 12 years old to pursue soccer. I hope to get a scholarship one day at a university for playing soccer. I also code, and the languages that I have learned so far are java, javascript, HTML, and CSS.

            <h2>Favorite Food</h2>
            <p>
              I love food. A mutual love of food can bring different people together and can make the saddest person feel a little better without even meaning to. My two favorite foods are pasta and fried or baked chicken wings.
